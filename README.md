# ðŸ›  Customer Churn Prediction with Transformer-Powered Insights

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using machine learning and enhancing interpretability with **GPT-powered explanations**.  
The goal is to help businesses **identify customers at risk of leaving** and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights
- Developed multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Achieved **87% accuracy** with the Random Forest model.
- Applied **feature engineering & exploratory data analysis** for deeper insights.
- Integrated **GPT (via LangChain + GPT-4)** to generate **personalized churn explanations** for each customer.
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC**.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP  
- **AI/LLM Integration:** LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## ðŸš€ Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualizing churn distribution, correlations, and customer behavior.  
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Creating meaningful features (e.g., tenure bins, contract types).  
4. **Model Training** â€“ Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC.  
6. **Explainability** â€“ Used SHAP values for feature importance and GPT for human-readable insights.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest (Accuracy: 87%, AUC: 0.90)  
- **Top Features Influencing Churn:** Contract type, Monthly charges, Tenure, Tech support availability.  
- **GPT-Powered Explanations:** Generated **personalized insights** explaining why a customer may churn, helping bridge the gap between ML outputs and business decision-making.

## ðŸ“ˆ For Instance, one of the GPT Output is:
*"Customer ID 5021 is at high risk of churn. Their short tenure (3 months), high monthly charges, and absence of technical support suggest dissatisfaction. Offering a loyalty discount or bundled tech support could improve retention."*
